# Social Media Manager - Test Results and Required Fixes

## Test Summary

Tested production deployment at: https://social-media-manager-production.up.railway.app

### Test Results: 75% Pass Rate (9/12 tests passed)

## ✅ Passing Features

1. **User Registration** - Working correctly
2. **User Login** - Authentication functional
3. **Auth Session** - Session management working
4. **Company Creation** - Companies can be created (without Facebook integration)
5. **Company List** - API returns company data correctly
6. **Campaign Creation** - Campaigns can be created successfully
7. **Analytics** - Real-time analytics data is returned
8. **Logout** - Session cleanup working
9. **Debug Endpoint** - Environment check available

## ❌ Failed Features & Required Fixes

### 1. Missing ENCRYPTION_KEY (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: The production environment is missing the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable.

**Impact**: 
- Facebook integration cannot work
- Content generation may fail
- Security features are compromised

**Fix Required**:
```bash
# In Railway dashboard, add environment variable:
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-character-encryption-key-here

# Generate a secure key:
openssl rand -hex 16
```

### 2. Health Check Endpoint (503 Error)

**Issue**: The `/api/health` endpoint returns 503 due to AI service check failing.

**Impact**: Load balancers and monitoring tools see the app as unhealthy.

**Fix**: The health check tries to test Gemini AI connection which may fail during cold starts.

### 3. Content Generation Failure

**Issue**: Content generation returns 500 error.

**Likely Cause**: Missing ENCRYPTION_KEY prevents proper initialization.

**Fix**: Add ENCRYPTION_KEY to environment variables.

## Production Environment Status

From debug endpoint check:
```json
{
  "hasEncryptionKey": false,      // ❌ MISSING - CRITICAL
  "hasFacebookAppId": true,       // ✅ Set correctly
  "hasFacebookAppSecret": true,   // ✅ Set correctly  
  "hasGeminiKey": true,          // ✅ Set correctly
  "nodeEnv": "production",       // ✅ Correct
  "encryptionKeyLength": 0       // ❌ Should be 32
}
```

## Manual Testing Guide

### 1. Test User Registration
- Navigate to: `/auth/register`
- Create account with email/password
- Verify redirect to dashboard

### 2. Test Company Creation (Without Facebook)
- Go to Dashboard → "Add New Company"
- Fill in:
  - Company Name
  - Brand Settings (voice, tone, audience)
  - Content Themes
  - Leave Facebook fields empty
- Save and verify creation

### 3. Test Campaign Creation
- From company page → "Create Campaign"
- Fill in campaign details
- Set content strategy and schedule
- Save and verify

### 4. Test Content Generation (After ENCRYPTION_KEY fix)
- From campaign → "Generate Content"
- Should create AI-generated posts
- Currently fails due to missing encryption key

### 5. Test Analytics
- Navigate to `/analytics`
- Verify real data displays (not fake data)
- Check date range filters work

## Required Railway Environment Variables

Add these in Railway dashboard under Variables:

```bash
# CRITICAL - MISSING
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<generate-32-char-key>

# Already Set (verify these)
DATABASE_URL=<your-postgres-url>
GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-key>
FACEBOOK_APP_ID=<your-app-id>
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=<your-secret>
SESSION_SECRET=<your-secret>
JWT_SECRET=<your-secret>
```

## Facebook Integration Testing (After fixes)

1. **Obtain Page Access Token**:
   - Use Facebook Graph API Explorer
   - Get long-lived page token
   - Test in debug endpoint first

2. **Create Company with Facebook**:
   - Add Facebook Page ID
   - Add Page Access Token
   - System will validate before saving

3. **Test Auto-posting**:
   - Create scheduled post
   - Run post scheduler job
   - Verify Facebook post created

## Performance Notes

- Cold starts may take 10-15 seconds
- Database queries are optimized
- Memory usage is within Railway limits
- No fake data remains in the system

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Add ENCRYPTION_KEY to Railway
2. **Test**: Re-run content generation after fix
3. **Monitor**: Check health endpoint after deployment
4. **Verify**: Facebook integration with real tokens

The application is 75% functional in production. The main blocker is the missing ENCRYPTION_KEY which prevents Facebook integration and content generation from working properly.
