# 🚀 Final Deployment Steps

## Current Status
Your application is deployed but needs the database connection configured properly.

## ✅ Two Options to Fix Database Connection

### Option 1: Update DATABASE_URL (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://railway.com/project/fbc12270-abfd-49c2-80f9-0d7adcd12cc3
2. Click "social-media-manager" service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Update `DATABASE_URL` to:
   ```
   postgresql://postgres:GqSnBFAkrAFIvEqfgRBcAknSfYPRzXQl@caboose.proxy.rlwy.net:51183/railway
   ```
5. Add new variable:
   ```
   RUN_MIGRATIONS=true
   ```
6. Save and redeploy

### Option 2: Manual Migration
After deployment, run:
```bash
railway run --service social-media-manager npm run db:deploy
```

## 📊 What's Deployed
