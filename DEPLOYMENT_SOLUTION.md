# 🔧 Database Connection Solution

## Current Issue
The database connection fails during build because Railway's internal networking (`postgres.railway.internal`) is only available after deployment, not during the build process.

## ✅ Solution: Update DATABASE_URL to Public URL

### Step 1: Update Environment Variable
1. Go to Railway Dashboard: https://railway.com/project/fbc12270-abfd-49c2-80f9-0d7adcd12cc3
2. Click on **"social-media-manager"** service (NOT Postgres or Redis)
3. Go to **"Variables"** tab
4. Find **DATABASE_URL** and click to edit
5. Replace with the PUBLIC database URL:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:GqSnBFAkrAFIvEqfgRBcAknSfYPRzXQl@caboose.proxy.rlwy.net:51183/railway
```

6. Save changes - Railway will automatically redeploy

### Step 2: After Deployment Completes
Once the app is deployed, run the database migration:

```bash
railway run --service social-media-manager npm run db:deploy
```

## 🎯 Why This Works
- **Public URL** (`caboose.proxy.rlwy.net:51183`) is accessible from anywhere
- **Internal URL** (`postgres.railway.internal:5432`) only works within Railway's network
- Build process needs external access, runtime can use internal

## 📊 Current Status
- ✅ Application code: Deployed and ready
- ✅ Database service: Running
- ✅ Redis service: Running
- ✅ Environment variables: Configured
- ⏳ Database schema: Needs migration after DATABASE_URL update

## 🚀 After Migration Success
Your app will be fully functional at:
https://social-media-manager-production.up.railway.app

**Important**: The public database URL is slightly slower than internal, but it's necessary for the build process. Once deployed, you could optionally switch back to the internal URL for better performance.
